# Employee Tracker App
## Using MySQL
### requires inquirer, mysql

# Features
* Allows tracking of all employees by various different types
* Allows adding, editing, and deleting employees, roles, departments, and managers
* Cool console log at the beginning

## Why I'm very cool
* MySQL is kind of ok and I get it
* validates
* Made lots of things dynamic

## Why node and async js suck
* Sometimes things just break because the connection is fussy about everything
* async and await never seem to work
* no one knows how any of this works
* so no one can tell me what's wrong
